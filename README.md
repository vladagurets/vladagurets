My name is [Vlad](https://www.www.linkedin.com/in/vladyslav-ohirenko).

Iâ€™m 5 years experienced web developer specializing in modern reactive & feature-rich web applications.

A couple of months ago I decided to dive into open-source community and currently Iâ€™m working on [react-cancellable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cancelable), which is library that helps care about internet traffic! Check out [project here](https://github.com/vladagurets/react-cancelable).
